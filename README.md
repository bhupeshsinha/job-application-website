# Job Application Form

I made a Job Application Form using HTML and CSS.

It is just for learning purpose.

During this project i learned my minute things about HTML, CSS, VSCode and many shortcuts that i never know earlier.

Some of the shortcuts like:
1. ! + enter = give html basic template

2. For renaming multiple name use: ctrl + d.

3. Few new things i learned like placing "upload", "select option", etc.

4. Its size is dynamic with respect to device.

5. link style.css : will link the css file with your html file.

6. .container_name : will make a div for you.
